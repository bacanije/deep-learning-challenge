For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants for funding from Alphabet Soup will be successful if funded. The dataset contains information on more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup, including various metadata such as application type, affiliation, organization classification, use case for funding, income classification, funding amount requested, and whether the funding was used effectively (IS_SUCCESSFUL).

By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, the goal is to analyze the provided dataset to identify patterns and relationships between the features and the success of the funded organizations. This analysis aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify new applicants into successful or unsuccessful categories based on their characteristics. Ultimately, the model will assist Alphabet Soup in selecting applicants with the best chance of success for funding, thereby optimizing their allocation of resources and maximizing the impact of their support.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
